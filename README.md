Problem Definition:
Design and implement a To-Do List application for managing tasks. The application should allow users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and view their list of tasks. Additionally, the app should persist the tasks so that they are retained even when the app is closed and reopened.

Requirements:

1. **Task Management:**
    - Users should be able to add new tasks to their to-do list.
    - Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.
    - Users should be able to delete tasks from the list.

2. **User Interface:**
    - The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily add, view, and manage their tasks.
    - Each task in the list should display its title and status (e.g., incomplete or completed).

3. **Persistence:**
    - The application should persist the list of tasks so that they are retained across app sessions.
    - Use appropriate data storage techniques (e.g., SQLite database, SharedPreferences, or Room database) to achieve data persistence.

4. **User Experience:**
    - The app should provide feedback to users when tasks are added, completed, or deleted.
    - Users should be able to interact with the app efficiently without encountering performance issues.

5. **Error Handling:**
    - The application should handle potential errors gracefully, such as invalid input when adding tasks or errors related to data persistence.

6. **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of critical functionalities, such as task addition, completion, and deletion.
    - Conduct manual testing to verify the usability and functionality of the application across different devices and screen sizes.

7. **Optional Features:**
    - Implement additional features such as task prioritization, task categories, due dates, or reminders for enhanced task management.
    - Add customization options for users to personalize their to-do lists (e.g., themes, font sizes).

8. **Accessibility and Localization:**
    - Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility best practices.
    - Support multiple languages and locales to cater to a diverse user base.

9. **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear and concise documentation for developers contributing to the project or maintaining the codebase in the future.
    - Document key components, classes, functions, and APIs to facilitate understanding and collaboration.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Prepare the application for deployment to the Google Play Store or other distribution platforms.
    - Address any necessary configurations or optimizations required for deployment.

Deliverables:
- Source code of the To-Do List application.
- Documentation outlining the app's functionalities, architecture, and usage instructions.
- Test cases and test results demonstrating the application's reliability and correctness.
- Deployment-ready APK file for distribution (if applicable).

Constraints:
- The application should adhere to Android platform guidelines and best practices.
- Consider performance constraints, especially when dealing with data persistence and UI responsiveness.
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of Android devices and OS versions.
- Respect user privacy and data security principles throughout the development process.
